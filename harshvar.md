## Harshvardhan

I'm Harsh, a fourth-year PhD student in Business Analytics, focusing on predictive optimization. I've done data science work with HP and Aspect Ratio. When I'm not diving into analytics, you'll find me reading history, writing blogs, or curating interesting online links. I also enjoy hiking in the Smoky Mountains and biking around Knoxville.
