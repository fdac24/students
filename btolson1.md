I am Brien Tolson. I am a Senior pursuing a bachelor's in Computer Science at UTK. As time has gone on, I've grown to enjoy coding more each year that I learn more about it. I am currently interning at TVA where I work with some automation and data entry. My current goal is to use Senior year to get a solid grasp of what I want to do as a career in the software world. I enjoy coding an data analysis, but I am not completely set on  one specific career path. In my free time, I enjoy exercising, going to the movie theatre, basketball, and video games. I recently was married in June 2024, and my wife and I do a lot of these activities together.  I hope to use this course to get more hands on experience visualizng and modeling data and to learn more about how to obtain specific data from the internet.
