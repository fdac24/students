I am Maria Hernandez, a senior in Computer Science minoring in Machine Learning. I enjoy playing instruments, drawing, sightseeing, working out, and programming. I'm very interested in Machine Learning and Neural Networks, both Deep Neural Networks and Spiking Neural Networks. I want to take Digital Archeology to develop skills in handling and interpreting complex datasets; crucial for developing robust Machine Learning models.
