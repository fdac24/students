My name is Malika Arifova and I am a senior. I am majoring in computer science with a business minor on the premed track.
My hobbies are gardening, traveling, and learning new languages. I chose this class because I was interested in digital archeology and data science. It seems very like it
would be a very useful skill in the future and would help with real world scenarios in the tech world.
