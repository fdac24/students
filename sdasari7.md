I'm Sai Deepika Dasari, a master's student in Computer Science at the University of Tennessee, Knoxville. With a strong background in AI and computer vision, I have over two years of experience in Customer Lifecycle Management and DevOps engineering. My passion lies in leveraging technology to solve complex problems and contribute to meaningful projects that create a positive impact.

In the *Foundations of Digital Archeology* course, I am particularly interested in learning how to work with operational data and the techniques involved in its processing and analysis. Gaining insights into methods for collecting, managing, and interpreting large datasets within a digital archaeology framework will complement my background in AI and data analysis.
