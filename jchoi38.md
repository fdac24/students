I am Jason Choi and I'm a senior majoring in computer science. I'm from Memphis, TN and I'm intersted in space and space technology.
I'm taking this class as its been recommended to me by multiple people, but also because I wanted to learn something new.
I have some experience with data analysis but I figured this class would focus on lower level concepts that I haven't touched on which I'm hoping to get more experience in.
