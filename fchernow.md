I'm Faith Chernowski and I'm a senior here at the University of Tennessee. I'm majoring in computer science and pursuring a minor in cybersecurity. I have web development and machine learning experience, so I hope to learn more about data analysis and manipulation while in this class. Outside of class I enjoy playing sports and I am in ROTC, so I will be working as an officer in the Army once I graduate.
