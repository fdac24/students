I'm William Winslade. I currently work as a network admin intern at KUB, and am a 4th year CS student at UT. I'm interested in enterprise computer networks, machine learning, and in general backend development as a whole.

In regards to this course, I'm hoping to get a good introduction to data analysis in general, as well as web scraping. Data analysis has always interested me but I've had little experience in it so far.
