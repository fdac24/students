> My name is John Turner Heath, but I typically go by Turner. I am a senior studying computer science at UT,
> and hope to transfer the skills I learn here into a fulfilling career of software development.
> I love breaking apart and analyzing systems to see how they work; when I discover a feature I like in a
> program, I like to see if I can look at the source code or reverse engineer it to see how it was done.
> I have always had a passion for all things computers and programming, and I belive this class will
> give me valuable skills that I can integrate in many of my current or future projects.
