I am Md Saif Hassan Onim. I am a PhD Student majoring in Computer Engineering. I am working on physiological sensor data and machine learning. Looking at the syllabus and course contents, I am sure to learn a lot about the data analysis and pre-processing techniques that will help me farther my research. During free times I like playing games on my PS5 and board games like Poker.
